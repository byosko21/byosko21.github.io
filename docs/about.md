After 22 years in the same town of College Station, Texas, I hope to take my analytical skills to new domains where I can broaden my experiences and skills. I will graduate from Texas A&M University in December of 2021, with a degree in Applied Mathematics, a minor in Economics, considerable coursework in Computer Science, and a wealth of experience in academic research. I am currently seeking employment in the fields of Data Science/Engineering, but would also love any opportunity to use my mathematical, statistical, and analytical skills to solve any problems that may need solving, and would greatly enjoy employment in Operations Research, Risk Analysis, Financial Analysis and any and all similar fields. I am a lifelong student and will hopefully spend the rest of my life learning new skills and improving myself in as many ways as are feasible.


I have great passion for many things in life, some of which you can see on the sidebar to the left. My love for science fiction books and other indoor activities are well balanced with my love for all things outdoors, and my strong desire to expand upon my outdoor experiences. I am also a very mediocre chess player, woodworker, painter, and writer, but these skills improve every day I get the opportunity to practice them, and I try to make those days come as often as possible.
